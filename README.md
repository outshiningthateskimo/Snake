# Snake
Snake Game similar to the original 1997 Nokia one (eyedropper green picked!). Brings back the old memories.

The idea of creating a Snake Game came by as a follow-up of being assigned to do a project for the Multimedia class.  
This was a team project and I was the one to start working on it.  

Thus, this is just the core structure of the game.  
Don't get me wrong, it works, you can directly download this repository if you want to and play the good ol' Snake game we all love.  
However, I would like to redirect you to the fully implemented project.

### What you will find in this version
This is what I implemented (which you can already find right here):
- the snake moves up, down, left, right
- randomly placed food
- the snake length increases with each piece of food consumed
- the UI has a cool looking design:
- black and green color scheme, much like the original Snake game
- it has a score board to track the player's progress

### What you will find in the completed version
My classmates continued my implementation by adding the following features:
- Audio API → collision, eating sounds
- Voice API → voice commands (up, down, left, right)
- a Game Over screen instead of an alert being triggered
