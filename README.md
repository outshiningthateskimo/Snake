# Snake
Snake Game similar to the original 1997 Nokia one (eyedropper green picked!). Brings back the old memories.

## Features
- the snake moves up, down, left, right
- randomly placed food
- the snake length increases with each piece of food consumed
- hitting the walls is not an issue, the snake teleports on the other side
- the UI has a cool looking design:
- black and green color scheme, much like the original Snake game
- it has a score board to track the player's progress
- Audio API → collision, eating sounds
- Voice API → voice commands (up, down, left, right)
- a Game Over screen instead of an alert being triggered
